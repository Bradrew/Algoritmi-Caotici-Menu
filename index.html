            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>Ristorante de Algoritmi Caotici</strong> at <strong>Pango's House!</strong> We serve artisanal dishes crafted with love,
            using locally sourced ingredients for every meal.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Founded by a proud graduate from The Oregon State University, our grand vision sought developing dishes that would encourage eating more vegetables. 
            We took a high aim for a healthier lifestyle and environmentally conscious behaviors. Drawing inspiration from dishes around the world with trial and 
            error and a hint of imagination, we have come to rest on dishes that give a taste of global diversity while retaining a comforting familiarity. I hope 
            you’ll enjoy eating these dishes as much as I enjoy making them!
            </p>

            <h2>A Word from the Kitchen</h2>
            <p>
                Here at Ristorante de Algoritmi Caotici, we strongly believe that meat consumption is not necessary for high quality cuisine. 
                Thus we craft each of our menu items with great attention to detail, while organically sourcing at least 90% of the ingredients. 
                As an important part of supporting our society, 
                we pledge to remain socially responsible in sourcing our supply chains, including considering our carbon footprint and fair labor agreements. 
                When you eat a meal at Ristorante de Algoritmi Caotici, you can sleep easy knowing that you contributed to reducing society’s obscene carbon footprint. 
                Enjoy the culinary experience, and remember, the best meals are often the ones you enjoy with the best company!

            <h2>Large Groups (> 4 people)</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately in our small industrial kitchen, we are unable to accomodate all options listed here 
                for groups over 4 people. Please don't let this discourage you, let your party size be known with ample lead time, 
                and we will make accomodations wherever possible. We look forward to hosting you!
